    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna starts with a flavorful ragu, made from minced meat, onion, and tomatoes, slowly cooked with Italian herbs. A creamy béchamel sauce with butter, flour, and milk adds smoothness.</p>
    <p>It’s layered in a baking dish, alternating lasagna sheets, sauces, and shredded cheese. Baked until golden, then rested briefly before serving.</p>
